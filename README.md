# FinancialAnalysisProject

This application takes an Excel file containing financial information as input and outputs an excel sheet containing graphical and quantitative analysis of this manager's performance in comparison to the benchmark. 

## How to use

Then, run the app.py file with the file path.

python3 app.py your_file_path.xlsx

After it has run, plots and data tables will be saved to an Excel sheet.
